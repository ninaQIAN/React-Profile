They are completely immersed in their own thoughts without caring whatever is going on outside. That's why sometimes you'll see a cat sitting silently on the mat, next to a window or on a couch, when suddenly jumps up and starts looking around. And the cat is also very cute. I hope some day in the futuer, I'll be able to raise a lovely kitten as a pet, care him and play with him like he's my little mate. I want to see him grow healthly and live happily with my family."
